# Release Notes v0.7.1
**Virtual RootFS & Unified CLI**

This release introduces a major refactor to the filesystem and CLI handling.

## New Features
- **Virtual RootFS**: A strict directory structure rooted at `~/.loop/`.
  - Allowed virtual roots: `/home`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/sandbox`, `/bin`, `/plugins`.
- **Unified CLI**: The `loop` command is now the single entry point.
  - `loop init`: Sets up the environment and migrates data.
  - `loop start`: Starts the shell (default).
  - `loop agent <task>`: Runs the AI Agent.

## Migration
Run `loop init` to migrate your existing `~/.loop/memory` to `~/.loop/var/memory`.

## Security
- All file operations are now confined to the virtual root.
- Path traversal protections are enforced by `rootfs.py`.
